            <center><h2>A Great But Ageing Genre: Fighting Games</h2></center><br>
            <pre>
            During the peak period of arcades in the 1990s, 2D fighting games were a popular culture phenomenon. 
            I spent countless hours honing my abilities in video games like Tekken as a gamer. 
            since an aspiring game developer today, I can't help but have a negative perspective on this stale 
            genre, since it gets harder and harder to draw in the next generation of players.
            
            </pre><br>
            <h4>
            Significant difficulty in mastery.
            </h4><br>
            <pre>
                There is a knowledge gap between younger and more experienced players because it takes practice 
                to master the controls. Veteran players easily adjust when a new fighting game is introduced since
                they are familiar with the learning curve from previous games. New players, on the other hand, must
                take the time to understand the experienced players are already ahead of the competition by the time 
                they master the controls.This disparity may discourage new players and result in them leaving the game.
            </pre><br>
            <h4>
                A 2D Camera Setup
            </h4><br>
            <pre>
                Although the camera may not be a fundamental issue, it is important to understand its design 
                implications because it contributes to the overall challenge of playing a combat game.
                Kung-Fu Master served as a source of inspiration for Street Fighter because it had a
                horizontal 2D camera, which was typical in earlier video games. However,when combined with 
                the challenging controls, this camera view may seem strange to new players who are used to 
                3D spatial movement.
            </pre><br>
            <h4>
                Conclusion
            </h4><br>
            <pre>
                Please understand that I'm not attempting to disparage the fighting game genre. 
                But because I love this genre so much, I believe that as long as this genre is based on 
                an arcade-based design, it will always be static among an audience of ageing players. 
                This is true regardless of how many new versions of Guilty Gear or The King of Fighters 
                are released or regardless of waiting for a potential new fighting game.
